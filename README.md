## Running the App

In order to run the app, pull the latest changes to the main branch via: "git pull". Then, reset and seed the database via "rails db:migrate:reset db:seed". This will give access to 5 created Mood Boards and their associated pins.  Then run the rails server via "rails server" and navigate your web browser to "http://localhost:3000/".
